  # To add assets to your application, add an assets section, like this:
  assets:
    - assets/images/chat.png
#    - images/a_dot_ham.jpeg

  # For details regarding adding assets from package dependencies, see
  # https://flutter.dev/to/asset-from-package

  # To add custom fonts to your application, add a fonts section here,
  # in this "flutter" section. Each entry in this list should have a
  # "family" key with the font family name, and a "fonts" key with a
  # list giving the asset and other descriptors for the font. For
  # example:
#  fonts:
#    - family: Schyler

  #      - assets/fonts/NunitoSans-Italic-VariableFont_YTLC,opsz,wdth,wght.ttf
